Original review for file: review2.txt

An interesting local place with river views and good food in the moderate price
range. It leans heavily toward sea food but there are menu items for the foul
and bovine inclined. Reservations for diner are a must, particularly on Friday
and Saturday or any day a popular show is appearing at the Count Basie Theatre.
Two appetizers and two entrees with nonalcoholic drinks set us back $91 with
tip. Fairly reasonable. We sat at a lovely set, uncomplicated, table with a
beautiful view of the Navesink river and it's boat traffic. The service was
polite, amiable and generally proficient about seeing to our needs. On this day
I opened with the caprese salad which was very nicely done. The pesto was a
tasty accent, not over powering. The wet mozzarella perfect and heirloom
tomatoes glorious. They flavors coming together very nicely. My wife had an
oyster dish that I'm having a senior moment trying to pull the name from
memory, however it's sauce was delicious (I'm not a big oyster fan). I kept my
entree simple: fish and chips. The fish was a nice thick piece of cod, not some
cod replacement and fried to perfection. The fries were fries. My wife had the
lobster roll, which she gave high marks. Overall a good place to dine before a
show or after a late afternoon/ early evening walk about. It's not child
adverse and a few dotted the tables while we were there but, at dinner at
least, it runs toward an adult crowd. The parking can be difficult on popular
show nights or Friday evening but the municipal lot is just across the street
and you don't have to pay after 6pm. It's a thumbs up here.

Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home
right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting
and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly
recommend! It was so nice staying at Garon's! For the first glance it didn't
look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It's
pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get
to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person,
very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture!
I'll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how
people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the
coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was
warm! "I had the most beautiful stay, Garon is a very special person and an
absolute angel, made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed
environment, I throughly recommend Bliss Art Space!

For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions

The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.
Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty
throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. This
apartment is convenient and functional. The huge skylight makes it feel open
and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly
recommended. Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet
and easy going. Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer
is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in.
We loved the apartment! Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience.
PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and
answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear &
zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to
everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated
that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone
coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great
host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is
walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library
were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and
great relaxing place to stay.

Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and
feeling throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was afraid. This
apartment is frustrated and functional. The huge skylight makes it feel open
and starving. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Highly
recommended. uncomfortable place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is
really brutal and depressed going. harsh and trapped spot in a very unique
building! Jennifer is a embarrassed host and was kind enough to meet us for out
late-night check-in. We embarrassing the apartment! Jennifer's space was such a
lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made
it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such
a unique, clear & zen energy- we mortal it. Not to mention it was very clean &
close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we
appreciated that)! We fiery the space and location & would recommend this to
anyone coming to explore the city!! "Jennifer was super blame and stunned.

Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We
spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April,
2012) and will remember this time as ours best. The apartment is pretty
spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is
everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very
friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend
this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the
center of the boiling Midtown!" We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer's charming
apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend
staying at the Midtown Castle!
